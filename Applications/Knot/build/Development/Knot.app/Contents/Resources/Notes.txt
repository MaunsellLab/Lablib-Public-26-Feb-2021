Cursor wants to be visible on the stimWindow when the mouse is the IODevice

• Turn of fixation calibration offset when entering FixateTask, and restore it later

• Saccade and EyeXY windows in Freestim are not registering previous visible states.

•RFMap wants ability to change fix spot color

• It would be good to put an LLScheduleController into Knot so that all modules could use it.
