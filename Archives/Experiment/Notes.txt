• Following problems on first time start up:
	Eye calibration values don't seem to be at default

• Need to set the sampling of eye position up to 500 Hz (from 200 Hz) when data collection has been fixed.
• There is some bug with changes in number of stimuli crashing the the behavior window (index > number at 
    end of the trial?)
	
	
Bindings:

	Need a way to know when a bound value changes, so that we can put the relevant event
		Need to see the values change when we change configurations
