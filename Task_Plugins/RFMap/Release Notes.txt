	added:			RFMap now gives a continuous display of stimulus azimuth and elevation in the control
					panel
					
	added:			RFMap will not post notifications of the stimulus position, so you can get the current
					mapping position into your plugin.  The posting is handled by a new entry in RFMap's
					Action menu, Send Position (keyboard command-'=').  This causes a Cocoa NSNotification
					to be sent.  You need to do four things in your LLPlugin object to receive these positions
					
					1) Your plugin will receive this notification if it registers to receive it and has an appropriate 
					method.  To register to receive the notification, you need the following in your "activate"
					method of the plugin:
					
						[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(stimPosition:)
									name:@"RFMapStimulusPositionDeg" object:nil];
									
					2) The selector entry (stimPosition: in the example) should be the name of the method in your
					plugin that will be called when the notification is posted.  This method should be declared
					as follows:
					
						- (void)stimPosition:(NSNotification *)notification;
						
					3) It will receive the notification object, will contain an NSValue containing an NSPoint with the
					positin in degrees.  For example,
					
						- (void)stimPosition:(NSNotification *)notification
						{
							NSValue *positionValue = [notification object];
							NSPoint positionPointDeg = [positionValue pointValue];
							
							NSLog(@"received position %f %f", positionPointDeg.x, positionPointDeg.y);
						}
					
					4) You should remove your plugin from the notification center in your inactivate method:
					
						[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];
